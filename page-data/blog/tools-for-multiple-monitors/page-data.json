Here are a few that I discovered recently that come in handy when working on multiple monitors.</p>\n<h2>CatchMouse</h2>\n<p><a href=\"//ftnew.com/catchmouse.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"      alignleft\" title=\"CatchMouse\" alt=\"CatchMouse\" src=\"//a5.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/087/Purple/v4/31/87/e8/3187e836-3305-5b22-8631-83f608442d10/icon.175x175-75.png\" width=\"120\" height=\"auto\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ever lose track of your mouse when working on multiple monitors? That happens to me a lot. <a href=\"//ftnew.com/catchmouse.html\" target=\"_blank\">CatchMouse</a> is a free app that solves that problem very simply, but effectively. With a user-defined keyboard shortcut, it centers your mouse in the screen and zooms it. You can set up a separate shortcut for each monitor, which not only helps you locate your mouse, but moves it to the screen where you're working. Bonus!</p>\n<h2>SizeUp</h2>\n<p><a href=\"//www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"   alignleft\" title=\"SizeUp\" alt=\"SizeUp\" src=\"//www.irradiatedsoftware.com/images/app-sizeup.png\" width=\"120\" height=\"auto\" /></a></p>\n<p>It helps to have a utility for moving and resizing windows, especially when working with multiple monitors. I was using <a href=\"//www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/\" target=\"_blank\">Cinch</a> to resize my windows, until I discovered it had a more powerful big brother. <a href=\"//www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/\" target=\"_blank\">SizeUp</a> lets you resize windows, <em>and</em> move them between monitors, all from the keyboard, using customizable keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n<h2>MenuPop</h2>\n<p><a href=\"//www.binarybakery.com/product.php?app=menupop\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"MenuPop\" alt=\"MenuPop\" src=\"//www.binarybakery.com/images/mp-main.png\" width=\"120\" height=\"auto\" /></a></p>\n<p>There are several utilities that copy the menu bar to each screen, but I didn't love any of them. <a href=\"//www.binarybakery.com/product.php?app=menupop\" target=\"_blank\">MenuPop</a> takes a more minimalist approach, giving you a context-menu popup of the menu bar items, activated with a user-defined keyboard shortcut.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tools for multiple monitors","date":"June 12, 2013","tags":["apps","tools"]},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/tools-for-multiple-monitors"}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Tools for multiple monitors","prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"MySQL SSH tunnel","tags":["command line","mysql","php"]},"excerpt":"If your MySQL server is configured to only accept local connections, then you can't connect remotely by just specifying the hostname in your…","fields":{"slug":"/blog/mysql-ssh-tunnel"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"CSS background patterns","tags":["css"]},"excerpt":"CSS is getting more and more awesome all the time.
