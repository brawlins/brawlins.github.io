If it works, you can move it to production, but if not, you can just throw it away. That's the beauty of branching with git! Here's an example workflow.</p>\n<h2>1. Create a local branch</h2>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git checkout -b feature</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now you have a new branch called \"feature\" and it's checked out. After you edit some files and commit the changes you'll want to push this new branch up the repository:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git push -u origin feature</code></pre></div>\n<h2>2. Test it on the server</h2>\n<p>The new branch is in the repository now, but it's not yet on the server, so you'll need to fetch it:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git fetch origin\ngit checkout --track origin/feature</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now you have a tracked and checked-out copy of the new branch on your server. Test, test, test!</p>\n<h2>3. Merge it into the master branch</h2>\n<p>Once you're satisfied that it works, you'll want to merge it into the master branch. Do that first locally:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git checkout master\ngit merge --no-ff feature</code></pre></div>\n<p>Then push up the changes to the repository:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git push origin master</code></pre></div>\n<h2>4. Delete the feature branch</h2>\n<p>You no longer need the feature branch, so let's delete it. First locally:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git branch -d feature</code></pre></div>\n<p>And then from the repository:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git push origin :feature</code></pre></div>\n<h2>5. Deploy on the server</h2>\n<p>Now you're ready to deploy it. SSH into the server and pull down the changes:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git pull origin master</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Git branch workflow","date":"August 28, 2013","tags":["command line","git"]},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/git-branch-workflow"}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Git branch workflow","prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Using Google web fonts","tags":["css"]},"excerpt":"Today I tried switching a website to web fonts.
